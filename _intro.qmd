Music Information Retreival (MIR) is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field focused on extracting feature or making predictions from musical representations. Music content analysis tools, such as MIRtoolbox [@lartillot_matlab_2007-1; @preisach_matlab_2008], Essentia [@bogdanov_essentia_nodate; @bogdanov_essentia_2013], Librosa [@mcfee_librosa_2015], jAudio [@mcennis_jaudio_nodate], Timbre Toolbox [@peeters_timbre_2011], Humdrum [@huron_music_2002], Music21 [@preisach_matlab_2008], and others extract a wide variety of these features (for instance, timing, timbre, pitch, and emotion features) — typically from audio files, but also from symbolic formats such as Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI).

Despite their widespread use in research and industry, independent or third-party evaluations of these tools are relatively rare. The MIR research community has developed incentives like Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) to formally assess a variety of music information retrieval tasks [@ras_advances_2010; @downie_music_2008]. Beyond MIREX, independent evaluations of music content analysis tools outside of the development process have answered key research questions relating to these tools and created resources for newcomers to orient themselves and select a tool suitable for their needs. @urbano_what_2014 tested the effect of audio quality factors (sample rate, bit rate, codec, and frame size) on the robustness of chroma features and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with 400 audio files across two notable extraction tools. @moffat_evaluation_2015 evaluated the diversity of features, user interface, data accessibility, and computational efficiency of ten MIR tools, but do not examine the effectiveness, accuracy, or consistency of their feature extraction. @kumar_testing_2015 tested the reliability of three pitch-based features in MIRtoolbox using a variety of instruments: however, it is unclear precisely what audio files were used and how representative they are of naturalistic musical stimuli. Tools for modifying audio files have provided a framework for the systematic testing of music content analysis tools [in particular, @mauch_audio_nodate]. In addition to these testing tools and evaluations, significant discussion has been devoted to the need for evaluation and testing of new extraction tools [@sturm_horse_2016; @urbano_evaluation_2013; @gomez_tonal_2006; @downie_scientific_2004; @cunningham_impact_2012]. The difficulties associated with testing subjective musical features, or features without a ground truth (some outcome or true value to be modeled), are often cited as one of the main barriers to more substantial evaluations. Indeed, part of the motivation for efforts like MIREX is to overcome difficulties associated with evaluating musical features [@downie_music_2008].

Similar to other computational and statistical tools, MIR algorithms are typically tested by comparing the output of an algorithm with a ground truth that reflects either the perceived reality of a feature or otherwise a physical or technical property of the acoustic sound wave. Synthesizing MIDI files can be particularly effective, as manipulating parameters such as tempo, pitch distribution, timbre, and dynamics can provide labeled data suitable for use as a ground truth in training and evaluation [@raffel_large-scale_nodate; @hu_bootstrap_nodate; @cataltepe_music_2007]. In the case of symbolically notated music, such as western classical music, structural features or labels specified by the composer such as title-specified keys, key signatures, tempo markings, etc. can provide an additional source of ground truth for evaluating analogous extracted features.

However, many features of music are highly subjective: for instance, mode is a highly culturally informed phenomenon that differs even among experts (Delle Grazie et al., in review), and the perception of consonance and dissonance is largely informed by inculturation [@lahdelma_is_2022]. The absence of an objectively verifiable ground truth complicates evaluation of algorithms, often relying on human labeled databases which can be challenging to develop or retrieve [@gomez_tonal_2006], and are generally limited in their generalizability.

We propose a method for evaluating the effectiveness and validity of a MIR algorithm that compares versions of the same composition. Although in principle this method could be applied with many styles, instruments, and genres, here we focus on classical piano repertoire, which is particularly well-suited to this task. Western classical piano music is predominantly learned from symbolic notation, and it is generally understood that although some features might differ across performances of the same composition (i.e. tempo, timbre; here referred to as variant features), others should not (i.e., mode, pitch distribution; here referred to as invariant features). Comparing the consistency of feature extractions across multiple performances, or versions, of the same composition offers an opportunity to clarify the ability of MIR tools to focus on specific dimensions of interest, particularly in the case of invariant features. While cover song identification, the task of identifying different versions of the same composition has been the subject of significant study [see @zheng_cover_2023 for a review], we are not aware of any attempts to use different performances of the same composition as an evaluation technique.

To assess consistency in algorithmic analysis of related musical passages, here we analyze the first eight measures of `r length(unique(data$albumID))` audio file versions of all 24 piano preludes from J.S. Bach’s “The Well Tempered Clavier” (WTC) Book 1 — `r length(unique(data$albumID)) * 24` files in total. The WTC is particularly suitable since its musical and historical significance has resulted in numerous professional recordings by renowned artists. A larger sample of versions is desirable for this method as outliers can disproportionately influence variability measures in smaller samples. Further, Bach’s work is still considered relevant and influential today, and is also the subject of significant study in MIR [@chen_attend_2021; @gotham_when_2023], music cognition [@battcock_acoustically_2019; @battcock_emotion_2022; @battcock_individualized_2021], computational musicology [@lieck_tonal_2020; @schmuckler_perceptual_2005; @temperley_whats_1999], and his compositions are frequently used in the context of music education.
